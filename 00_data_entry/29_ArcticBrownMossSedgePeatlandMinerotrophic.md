# Description Data Entry

## Overview

**Unit Name:** Arctic Brown Moss-Sedge Peatland, Minerotrophic

**Level:** Map Class

**Code:** 29

**Concept:** This [level] encompasses minerotrophic peatlands underlain by near-surface permafrost in histel soils dominated or co-dominated by combinations of hydrophytic taxa within Cyperaceae or hydrophytic, non-*Sphagnum* mosses (i.e., “brown” mosses).

## Vegetation

### Structure

**Structural Description:** This [level] is dominated by sedges and mosses. Other structural groups may be present at low abundance.

**Structural Class:** sedge emergent

### Floristics

**Floristics Description:** This [level] is indicated by combinations of hydrophytic taxa within Cyperaceae (i.e., wetland sedges) or hydrophytic, non-*Sphagnum* mosses (i.e., “brown” mosses). Diagnostic species are best considered as sets rather than individual species. Dominant species are highly variable, but <i>Carex aquatilis</i> and <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i> have high constancy and frequently high cover. Less frequently, other hydrophytic species in Cyperaceae or brown mosses, such as those in the *Scorpidium*, may be dominant. <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses are often present but only at low cover (< 10%).
