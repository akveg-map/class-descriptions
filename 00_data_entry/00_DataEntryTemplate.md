# Description Data Entry Template

**Instructions:** After entering data, delete the instruction section. *Only replace text that is shown in Italics in this data entry template.* Once you replace the italicized text, remove the italics (except for taxon names). Do not modify any bracketed text, such as [bracketed_text]. Bracketed text will be replaced by data summaries from the AKVEG Database. Do not modify plain text, which is standard language for all descriptions. Alliance descriptions will follow a similar format but use a different repository in the AKNVC project.

## Overview

**Unit Name:** *Enter map class name.*

**Level:** Map Class

**Code:** *Enter map class code (i.e., raster value in map and code in AKVEG schema).*

**Concept:** This [level] *complete this single sentence to provide an overview of the type.*

**Photos:** *Enter a comma separated list of three to five representative photos. Use the photo file path or server url.*

## Placement in AKNVC Hierarchy

**Macrogroup Code:** *Enter the macrogroup code (starting with "M").*

**Macrogroup:** *Enter the macrogroup name.*

**Group Code:** *Enter the group code (starting with "G").*

**Group:** *Enter the group name.*

## Vegetation

### Structure

**Structural Description:** *Enter up to a single paragraph describing the typical structure of the vegetation. Avoid providing information redundant with the data summaries below.*

**Structural Class:** *Enter one or more structural classes from the AKVEG Data Dictionary*

Table 1. Mean and range for structural characteristics for [unit_name].

[table_structure]

[structure_plot]

Figure 1. Plot of structural group proportions for [unit_name].

### Floristics

**Floristics Description:** *Enter up to a single paragraph describing the diagnostic floristic traits.*

[diagnostic_plot]

Figure 2. Plot of range from 10th percentile to 90th percentile and mean for diagnostic species (and species sets) occuring in [unit_name]. Diagnostic species (sets) are included if they have constancy >= 25% and mean cover >= 2% or constancy >= 50% and mean cover >= 1%.

Table 2. Constancy and cover table for individual taxa with constancy >= 25% and mean cover >= 2% or constancy >= 50% and mean cover >= 1% occuring in [unit_name].

[table_composition]

[composition_plot]

Figure 3. Plot of range from 25th percentile to 75th percentile and mean for individual taxa occuring in [unit_name]. Individual taxa are included if they have constancy >= 25% and mean cover >= 2% or constancy >= 50% and mean cover >= 1%.

## Range

**Range Description:** *Enter up to one paragraph describing the general range. Use standard terms, prioritizing the AKVEG bioclimatic zones and vegetation regions (but using ecoregions or other geographic terms where more specificity is helpful). Do not attempt to provide a level of detail redundant with the vegetation map.*

**Rarity on Landscape:** *Enter one of the following: Ubiquitous; Common; Uncommon; Rare*

## Environment

**Physiography**: [physiography_text]

**Geomorphology:** [geomorph_text]

**Macrotopography:** [macrotopo_text]

**Microtopography:** [microtopo_text]

**Moisture Regime:** [moisture_text]

**Restrictive Layer:** [restrict_text]

**Percentage of Sites with Surface Water Present:** [surfacewater_frequency]

Table 3. Mean and range for quantitative environmental characteristics for [unit_name].

[table_environment]

ǂ Negative values represent distance to water table from soil surface while positive values represent depth of water above soil surface. Values of zero (0) represent water at the soil surface.
